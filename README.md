# TriPhoto
A simple python macro to tidy my photos.
It uses the repertory specified in cible to tidy the images by year and season.
The photos must be put in the repertory specified in source.

The macro uses the PIL library to extract Exif tags from the photo to be able to put the image in the right drawer.
